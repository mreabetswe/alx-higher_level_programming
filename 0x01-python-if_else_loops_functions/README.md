What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
1. The last digit
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4. Hexadecimal printing
Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)
5. 00...99
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.
6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
7. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
8. To uppercase
Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
11. a ^ b
Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
12. Fizz Buzz
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
13. Insert in sorted linked list
Technical interview preparation:
14. Smile in the mirror
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
15. Remove at position
Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
16. ByteCode -> Python #2
Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
